Apart from the voltage supply connections the important pins from the programming perspective are the data lines(8-bit Data bus), Register select, Read/Write and Enable pin.

Data Bus: As shown in the above figure and table, an alpha numeric lcd has a 8-bit data bus referenced as D0-D7. As it is a 8-bit data bus, we can send the data/cmd to LCD in bytes. It also provides the provision to send the the data/cmd in chunks of 4-bit, which is used when there are limited number of GPIO lines on the microcontroller.

Register Select(RS): The LCD has two register namely a Data register and Command register. Any data that needs to be displayed on the LCD has to be written to the data register of LCD. Command can be issued to LCD by writing it to Command register of LCD. This signal is used to differentiate the data/cmd received by the LCD.
If the RS signal is LOW then the LCD interprets the 8-bit info as Command and writes it Command register and performs the action as per the command.
If the RS signal is HIGH then the LCD interprets the 8-bit info as data and copies it to data register. After that the LCD decodes the data for generating the 5x7 pattern and finally displays on the LCD.

Read/Write(RW): This signal is used to write the data/cmd to LCD and reads the busy flag of LCD. For write operation the RW should be LOW and for read operation the R/W should be HIGH.

Enable(EN): This pin is used to send the enable trigger to LCD. After sending the data/cmd, Selecting the data/cmd register, Selecting the Write operation. A HIGH-to-LOW pulse has to be send on this enable pin which will latch the info into the LCD register and triggers the LCD to act accordingly.

Procedure:
For creation of project on    Kiel μ vision 5 Development environment (LPC21 XX/48/38)
1.	Click on the menu Project — New µVision Project creates a new project. Select an empty folder and enter the project name, for example Project1. It is good practice to use a separate folder for each project.
2.	Next, the dialog Select Device for Target opens.

Figure -02 Target selection


Select the device database. Default is Software Packs. You can have various local device databases, which show up in the drop-down box. For legacy devices (Arm7, Arm9), use the Legacy Device Database [no RTE]
3.	Select the device for your application. This selection defines essential tool settings such as compiler controls, the memory layout for the linker, and the Flash programming algorithms.
4.	Click OK.
5.	Click on the new file option and save the file using save option with .C extension 
6.	Build all for the hex code in the output of the target

For creating the simulation environment in Proteus suite 
Starting New Design


Step 1: Open ISIS software and select New design in  File menu

Figure -03 Proteus File Menu

 Step 2: A dialogue box appears to save the current design. However, we are creating a new design file so you can click Yes or No depending on the content of the present file. Then a Pop-Up appears asking to select the template. It is similar to selecting the paper size while printing. For now select default or according to the layout size of the circuit.

Step 3:An untitled design sheet will be opened, save it according to your wish,it is better to create a new folder for every layout as it generates other files supporting your design. However,it is not mandatory.

Step 6: Select the components from categories or type the part name in Keywords text box.
 Place all the required components and route the wires i.e, make connections.
Either selection mode above the component mode or component mode allows to connect through wires. Left click from one terminal to other to make connection. Double right-click on the connected wire or the component to remove connection or the component respectively.
